First copy the MASTER files to regular files. DO NOT modify the master files,
or it may cause trouble if you do git pull to get updates.

cp lpt.cron.MASTER lpt.cron
cp lpt_contab_wrapper.MASTER.sh lpt_contab_wrapper.sh
cp download_cmorph_rt.MASTER.sh download_cmorph_rt.sh
cp download_cfs_rt.MASTER.sh download_cfs_rt.sh
cp lpt_run_cmorph.MASTER.py lpt_run_cmorph.py
cp lpt_run_cfs_fcst.MASTER.py lpt_run_cfs_fcst.py

In each of these files, there are paths that need to be changed
in the first few lines, after the files are copied.


Notes:
- The download scripts are separate from the LPT running scripts.
- The MASTER scripts are set up to run once a day for 00 UTC starting/ending times.
- The shell scripts can be manually called for past dates by including YYYYMMDD
  as a command line arg.
- The python LPT scripts can be run manually by specifying the beginning and end
  time as command line args, formatted: YYYYMMDDHH.
- See the .py scripts for increasing/decreasing the detail of the outputs,
  especially the mask files.
