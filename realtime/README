First copy the MASTER files to regular files. DO NOT modify the master files,
or it may cause trouble if you do git pull to get updates.

cp lpt.cron.MASTER lpt.cron
cp lpt_crontab_wrapper.MASTER.sh lpt_crontab_wrapper.sh
cp download_cmorph_rt.MASTER.sh download_cmorph_rt.sh
cp download_cfs_rt.MASTER.sh download_cfs_rt.sh
cp lpt_run_cmorph.MASTER.py lpt_run_cmorph.py
cp lpt_run_cfs_fcst.MASTER.py lpt_run_cfs_fcst.py

In these files, there are several paths that need to be set
after the files are copied:
- For the Python scripts, change the line with dataset['raw_data_parent_dir'].
- For the download scripts, change the WORKDIR to where the data will be downloaded.
- For the crontab, change the LPT_REALTIME_DIR.


Notes:
- The download scripts are separate from the LPT running scripts.
- The MASTER scripts are set up to run once a day for 00 UTC starting/ending times.
- The shell scripts can be manually called for past dates by including YYYYMMDD
  as a command line arg.
- The python LPT scripts can be run manually by specifying the beginning and end
  time as command line args, formatted: YYYYMMDDHH.
- The Python scripts are set up to write output to ./data and ./images.
  To change this, change the output['data_dir'] and output['img_dir'] lines.
- See the .py scripts for increasing/decreasing the detail of the outputs,
  especially the mask files.
